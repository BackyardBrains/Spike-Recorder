 * For more info about the EDF and EDF+ format, visit: http://edfplus.info/specs/
 *
 * For more info about the BDF and BDF+ format, visit: http://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/bdfplus%20format%20description.html
 *
 * note: In EDF, the resolution (or sensitivity) (e.g. uV/bit) and offset are stored using four parameters:
 * digital maximum and minimum, and physical maximum and minimum.
 * Here, digital means the raw data coming from a sensor or ADC. Physical means the units like uV.
 * The resolution in units per least significant bit is calculated as follows:
 *
 * units per bit = (physical max - physical min) / (digital max - digital min)
 *
 * The digital offset is calculated as follows:
 *
 * offset = (physical max / units per bit) - digital max
 *
 * For a better explanation about the relation between digital data and physical data,
 * read the document "Coding Schemes Used with Data Converters" (PDF):
 *
 * https://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?baseLiteratureNumber=sbaa042
 *
 * note: An EDF file usually contains multiple so-called datarecords. One datarecord usually has a duration of one second (this is the default but it is not mandatory!).
 * In that case a file with a duration of five minutes contains 300 datarecords. The duration of a datarecord can be freely choosen but, if possible, use values from
 * 0.1 to 1 second for easier handling. Just make sure that the total size of one datarecord, expressed in bytes, does not exceed 10MByte (15MBytes for BDF(+)).
 *
 * The RECOMMENDATION of a maximum datarecordsize of 61440 bytes in the EDF and EDF+ specification was usefull in the time people were still using DOS as their main operating system.
 * Using DOS and fast (near) pointers (16-bit pointers), the maximum allocatable block of memory was 64KByte.
 * This is not a concern anymore so the maximum datarecord size now is limited to 10MByte for EDF(+) and 15MByte for BDF(+). This helps to accommodate for higher samplingrates
 * used by modern Analog to Digital Converters.
 *
 * EDF header character encoding: The EDF specification says that only (printable) ASCII characters are allowed.
 * When writing the header info, EDFlib will assume you are using Latin1 encoding and it will automatically convert
 * characters with accents, umlauts, tilde, etc. to their "normal" equivalent without the accent/umlaut/tilde/etc.
 * in order to create a valid EDF file.
 * The description of an EDF+ annotation on the other hand, is always encoded in UTF-8 (which is foreward compatible with ASCII).
 *
 * The samplefrequency of a signal is calculated as follows: sf = (smp_in_datarecord * EDFLIB_TIME_DIMENSION) / datarecord_duration
 *
 * Annotation signals
 * ==================
 *
 * EDF+ and BDF+ store the annotations in one or more signals (in order to be backwards compatibel with EDF and BDF).
 * The numbering of the signals in the file is zero based (starts at 0). Signals used for annotations are skipped by EDFlib.
 * This means that the annotationsignal(s) in the file are hided.
 * Use the function edf_get_annotation() to get the annotations.
 *
 * So, when a file contains 5 signals and the third signal is an annotations signal, the library will
 * report that there are only 4 signals in the file.
 * The library will "map" the signal numbers as follows: 0->0, 1->1, 2->3, 3->4.
 * This way you don't need to worry about which signals are annotationsignals, the library will take care of it.
 *
 * How the library stores time values
 * ==================================
 *
 * To avoid rounding errors, the library stores some timevalues in variables of type long long int.
 * In order not to lose the subsecond precision, all timevalues are scaled with a scaling factor: 10000000.
 * This will limit the timeresolution to 100 nanoSeconds. To calculate the amount of seconds, divide
 * the timevalue by 10000000 or use the macro EDFLIB_TIME_DIMENSION which is declared in edflib.h.
 * The following variables use this scaling when you open a file in read mode: "file_duration", "starttime_subsecond" and "onset".
