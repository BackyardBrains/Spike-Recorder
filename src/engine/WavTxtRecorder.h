/* Metadata Format
 *
 * Spike Recorder saves metadata to the files it exports. This is done to keep
 * record of color, position, threshold and other properties of the channels
 * recorded so those can be restored when the file is loaded again.
 *
 * This information is written in the LIST INFO chunk of the RIFF format, which
 * allows to store it in a key/value way.
 *
 * The keys used for this are
 *
 * cpos        channel positions (float)
 * ctrs        channel thresholds (int)
 * cgin        channel gains (float)
 * cclr        channel colors index (int)
 * cnam        channel names (string)
 *
 * ctms        global time scale (see AudioView.cpp) (float)
 *
 *
 * The values associated with those keys have the following format
 *
 *         val0;val1;val2;...;valn;
 *
 * Where val0 to valn are ascii strings containing the value for the n-th
 * channel. floats/ints are represented in a format understood by atof()/atoi()
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * cpos   0.243;0.123;0.4565;
 *
 * channel 1 is at position 0.243, channel 2 at position 0.123 and channel 3
 * at position 0.4565.
 *
 *
 * Global values like ctms are specified the same way, just with only one value:
 *
 * ctms 0.0768;
 *
 */

/* Marker File Format
 *
 * The time markers of a recording are saved in a separate plain text file
 * with the same filename as the audio file suffixed with "-events.txt".
 *
 * e.g.:
 *
 * Audio File: test.wav
 * Marker File: test-events.txt
 *
 * If a file like that is present in the same directory as the loaded audio
 * file, the markers are read from it and displayed in the audio view.
 *
 * The structure of the Marker File is CSV-like. There are two columns,
 * separated by ','. The first column represents the markers name, the second
 * column represents it’s position in seconds from the beginning.
 *
 * There are some rules for the name: it must not contain a comma and it must
 * not be empty.
 * Names starting with '_neuron' are considered spike train data and displayed
 * differently.
 * Apart from that it can be an arbitrary string.
 *
 *
 *
 * The marker position is a floating point number as understood by atof and
 * must not be empty either. Any amount of white space in the second column is
 * ignored.
